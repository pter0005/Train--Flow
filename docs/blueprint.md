## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(210, 70%, 50%) which converts to a shade of blue (#3399FF), suggesting trust and expertise.
- Background color: A desaturated version of the primary color, around HSL(210, 20%, 95%) which converts to a very light grey (#F0F5FA), for a clean and professional feel.
- Accent color: An analogous color to the primary, shifted by approximately 30 degrees, resulting in HSL(180, 80%, 40%), or a shade of cyan (#33CCCC), used to highlight key interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines to give a modern and techy look, combined with 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text for a neutral and objective reading experience.
- Use clean and modern icons to represent different exercises, muscle groups, and progress metrics. The style should match the overall minimalist design.
- Implement a card-based layout for displaying training sheets, exercises, and student profiles to enhance readability and organization.
- Subtle animations on workout completion, data updates, and transitions to provide engaging feedback without being distracting.
